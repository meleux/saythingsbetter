              <h3>Hi, I’m Lila Smith, and I want to help you Say Things Better.</h3>
              <p>Using my own theater-based Intentional Communication methodology, I help entrepreneurs and business leaders to identify and express their true brand value. I help them speak to the people who need to hear their message, in the way they’ll BEST be able to receive it.</p>
              <p>This lights up content marketing strategy, LinkedIn profiles, pitch language, customer service templates and guidelines, and the internal policies that empower employees to become authentic ambassadors.</p>
              <p>My tools are also helpful untricking tricky interpersonal and professional communication!</p>
              <p>Ever find yourself saying "it was never my intention to offend you"? Next time, ask yourself if you know what your intention WAS, not just what it wasn't.</p>
